            <h1>About SPoorthi'18</h1>
            SPoorthi was first organized in the year 2007 by the Sports Council of SPCE-SPIT to revive the city's engineering college
            sports and thereafter it has only got bigger every year. This year, as we completed decade of keeping the Spoorthi
            alive, we plan to make it bigger than ever before, by organizing a Mini-Marathon: the SP-Marathon 2017. We will
            be having colleges from Mumbai, Pune and Nasik to show their skills and strength in 15 different sports events.
            It's one of the biggest Sports Festival happening across the Engineering colleges in Mumbai providing an opportunity
            for the city's best Sports talents to showcase their skills. Spoorthi experiences not only engineering but also
            colleges from Arts, Commerce, Law and Management backgrounds. Keeping the Spoorthi of the game alive, around
            1400 athletes will exhibit their grit and hard work during the 9 day long festival which has always had an overwhelming
            crowd to support them. This year, to empower our initiative of Mini Marathon for a social cause, we are expecting
            500+ athletes including students, teachers and even senior citizens which would turn our intentions into a big
            success.
